# Watch Along App

MULTIUSER WATCH PARTY APPLICATION: Working in a team, my group and I created a web application that enables multiple users to join and stream YouTube videos in real-time. Upon starting the application, users are prompted to join a party or create their own. Input values allow for YouTube video links to be included when creating a party as well as having a reference link provided to share with friends. Using a YouTube API, the application allows users to stream audio, video, and YouTube content in real-time. With randomly generated namespaces, the users had a private connection through a socket.io server that allowed them to securely communicate.
